The site provides the students anonymity in their individual text reviews, accompanied by the Grade recieved by the student, their year levels, and the title of the course. The site does not publish the ratings given to Professors by individual reviewers; instead Polyratings also provides a Full Statisticial Analysis page for each professor with 5+ reviews/ratings to perform aggregate calculations including mean, median, mode, and standard deviations grouped by the students' grades earned or year levels. \n",
